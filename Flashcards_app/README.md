# Hello World!
  
Flashcards app is designed to help you learn English words. It just follows the basic principle of flashcards: show/hide definition, list cards.
Also you can work with words: add new ones, remove or edit them.  
You can set options: choose set of cards, shuffle cards, always flash definition.  
Words/cards info is stored in sqlite3 database.  
  
``` Python + sqlite3 + Tkinter used ```
