<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>"HyperJob" is a recruitment agency founded back in 1970. Its managers still prefer to communicate by phone or email and search for employees in an old-fashioned way. That was an efficient strategy some twenty years ago, but nowadays, potential employees prefer to apply for jobs online. The problem is that "HyperJob" still doesn't have a website, so they want you to develop one as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The website should allow recruiters to create vacancies and job seekers to create resumes.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>We need to safely store all the vacancies and resumes in a database. Your first task is to develop data models to manage the database tables.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary"> Use the default settings of the project with the predefined SQLite database. </div></p>

<p>Throughout the project, we will need at least two models: <code class="java">Vacancy</code> and <code class="java">Resume</code>. Both of them should have <code class="java">description</code> and <code class="java">author</code> fields. The <code class="java">description</code> field is a text field for no more than 1024 symbols and the <code class="java">author</code> field is a foreign key linked to the <code class="java">django.contrib.auth.models.User</code> model.</p>

<p>Define <code class="java">Vacancy</code> and <code class="java">Resume</code> in the <em>models.py </em>module and migrate them to the database.</p>
