<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>The system you're creating is almost ready for customers to use, but you also need to add features designed for the Hypercar operators who process the orders. One of their requirements is to be able to view the current length of each queue. For example, if the queue lengths are 3, 4, and 1, the following should be displayed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Change oil queue: 3</li>
	<li>Inflate tires queue: 4</li>
	<li>Get diagnostic queue: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>They also want the ability to select when to process the next customer. A simple button that can be clicked to complete this action will work just fine.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>You need to create an operator menu page containing three <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements with the content shown in the above list. The last element on the page should be a <code class="language-html">&lt;form&gt;</code> with the <code class="language-html">method</code> attribute equal to <code class="language-html">"post"</code>.</p>

<p>The form should contain a <code class="language-html">&lt;button&gt;</code> element with the <code class="language-html">type</code> attribute equal to <code class="language-html">"submit"</code>, and the button's label should be <code class="language-html">Process next</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;Change oil queue: 3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Inflate tires queue: 4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Get diagnostic queue: 1&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;form method="post"&gt;{% csrf_token %}
  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Process next&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Please don't implement the handler for the form action yet â€” this is something you will do in the next step.</p>

<p>The operator menu page should be available at <em>&lt;base_url&gt;/processing</em>, where <em>&lt;base_url&gt;</em> is the host.</p>

<p>Note that the processing URL doesn't contain a slash at the end, so your URL pattern shouldn't either. You can redirect GET requests to the right page with the help of <code class="language-html">RedirectView</code> if you need to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from django.views.generic import RedirectView

urlpatterns = [
   # some other patterns
   path('processing/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/processing'))
]</code></pre>
