<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Success! We did it, and the online service is up and running. HyperJob is now receiving dozens of emails and phone calls; however, some of the job hunters are complaining as they still cannot log in to publish their resumes.</p>

<p>You receive an email from the CTO of HyperJob:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">FROM: oficial@hyperjob.com
TO: you@hyperjob.com
DATE: today
SUBJECT: Thanks for the great work

Congratulations, weâ€™ve made a really important step. Great job, we are proud to have such professionals in our team! Could you start working on user authentication next?</code></pre>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Your task is to implement authentication on the website. You need to create two pages: one for new users to sign up and create their accounts and another to log in with their username and password.</p>

<p>Please use <code class="language-python">django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm</code> for your signup handler and <code class="language-python">django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm</code> for the login handler.</p>

<p>If the login request is successful, redirect the user to the menu page.</p>

<p>If you start the application on your computer with the <code class="language-html">python manage.py runserver</code> command, the signup page should be available at the address <code class="language-html">localhost:8000/signup</code> and the login page should be at <code class="language-html">localhost:8000/login</code>.</p>

<p>Please pay attention that the <em>login</em> and <em>signup</em> URLs do not have a slash at the end, so your URL patterns should not have it either. You can redirect GET requests to the right page with the help of <code class="language-html">RedirectView</code> if you need to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from django.views.generic import RedirectView
 
urlpatterns = [
   # some other patterns
   path('login/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/login'))
   path('signup/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/signup'))
]</code></pre>
