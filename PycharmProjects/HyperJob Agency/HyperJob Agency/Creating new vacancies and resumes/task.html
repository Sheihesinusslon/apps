<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Now, you've implemented authentication, but HyperJob users still cannot create their profiles or publish their resumes. Our final step is to create a page that will allow users to do that. We are one step away from having a fully functional dynamic website for HyperJob!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Your task is to make a new page with two handlers: one for creating vacancies and another for creating resumes. Only HyperJob managers can create vacancies, and only registered users can create resumes. When a new item is created, it should appear on the appropriate resume or vacancy page.</p>

<p>How can we distinguish managers from job hunters? To do that, you can use the boolean field <code class="java">is_staff</code> in <code class="java">django.contrib.auth.models.User</code>. If it's <em>true</em>, the user is a manager; otherwise, they are a candidate. Unauthenticated users are not allowed to create either vacancies or resumes. To check if a user is authenticated, you can use the <code class="java">request.user.is_authenticated</code> property in your handler.</p>

<p>You can use an HTML form or define one with Django forms. The form to create a vacancy or a resume should be on the profile page. The main requirement is that the handlers should receive only one <code class="java">POST</code> parameter: <code class="java">description</code>. That's enough to create a new item.</p>

<p>If the request is successful, redirect the user back to their profile; otherwise, respond with a <code class="java">403 (Forbidden)</code> status code.</p>

<p>If you start the application on your computer with the <code class="java">python manage.py runserver</code> command, the profile page should be available at  <code class="java">localhost:8000/home</code>, a new resume can be created at <code class="java">localhost:8000/resume/new</code>, and a new vacancy at <code class="java">localhost:8000/vacancy/new</code>.</p>
