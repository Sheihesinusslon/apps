<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>There are two or three hard-working mechanics based in the service center every day, and they deal with customers in the order they arrive. If several turn up at the same time, the line of waiting customers can become really long. Usually, diagnostic tests take 30 minutes, inflating tires takes five minutes, and oil changes take about two minutes.</p>

<p>The company recently conducted a survey and discovered that customers are prepared to wait in the queue for longer if the type of service they require takes more time. To reflect this, a new processing algorithm needs to be implemented:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Any customers waiting in line for an oil change should be served first.</li>
	<li>Those who want their tires inflated should be dealt with next.</li>
	<li>Customers who require a diagnostic check should be served last.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tickets need to be given a reference number so they can be distinguished from each other. The first ticket issued will be number 1, the second will be number 2, and so on. Not all customers are prepared to wait for a long time, so the system also needs to display an estimate of how long it will be until their turn. Don't forget that the line should be processed in the correct order!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Your task is to create a handler that gives tickets to the customers. The handler should serve GET requests on the following URLs:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>&lt;base_url&gt;/get_ticket/change_oil</em></li>
	<li><em>&lt;base_url&gt;/get_ticket/inflate_tires</em></li>
	<li><em>&lt;base_url&gt;/get_ticket/diagnostic</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Each page should contain a <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code> element with the content <em>Your number is &lt;ticket_number&gt;</em>, where <em>&lt;ticket_number&gt;</em> is the ticket's reference number. To calculate the estimated time, you should sum the time it will take to process all the tickets that will be worked on before the current one, according to the above algorithm. The estimated time should be in a <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code> element with the content <em>Please wait around &lt;minutes_to_wait&gt; minutes</em>, where <em>&lt;minutes_to_wait&gt;</em> is the estimated number of minutes:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;Your number is 7&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Please wait around 49 minutes&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary"> To store the data, you can use Python dictionaries and lists. For example, you could create a dictionary called <code class="language-html">line_of_cars</code> with keys matching the service names and values that are the lists of customer tickets. </div></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>If you have two customers that require an oil change, three customers waiting for their tires to be inflated, and one needing diagnostics, the estimated time for the next customer would be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To change oil: 2 * 2 minutes = 4 minutes</li>
	<li>To inflate tires: 2 * 2 minutes + 3 * 5 minutes = 19 minutes</li>
	<li>To get diagnostics: 2 * 2 minutes + 3 * 5 minutes + 1 * 30 minutes = 49 minutes</li>
</ul>
