<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Hypercar Ltd is a little-known car manufacturer. Last year was very successful for the company: they doubled their profit and managed to sell about ten thousand cars! Every Hypercar vehicle needs to be fixed or serviced at some point, so the company has opened several service centers. After opening the centers, managers soon noticed that their operating procedures needed to be optimized to improve customer experience. To do this, they want a web application that can handle queue management, and they would like you to implement the system.</p>

<p>You will achieve this by creating a Django project called "hypercar"<em> </em>that contains a "tickets" application. This application will have a server that creates new tickets for customers and ensures that the queue is ordered correctly.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>The first thing the system should do is greet all the service's customers, so you need to implement a welcome page that displays the right message.</p>

<p>To emphasize the text, you should create an <code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;</code> element with the content <code class="language-html">Welcome to the Hypercar service!</code>, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to the Hypercar Service!&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The project will have several URLs for different tasks, so please make this page available at <em>&lt;base_url&gt;/welcome</em>, where <em>&lt;base_url&gt;</em> is the host. If you start the application on your computer with the <code class="language-html">python manage.py runserver</code> command, the host will be <em>localhost:8000</em>.</p>

<p>If the server returns the page at the address <em>http://localhost:8000/welcome, </em>you can be sure that it's working correctly!</p>
