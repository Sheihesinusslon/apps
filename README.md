# Hi there!  

My name is Nikita. I'm 31, from Russia, Saint Petersburg. Currently, I live and work as a software engineer in Barcelona, Spain.
  
In 2020 I started learning Programming and Computer Science. I was contemplating my professional field.  
I thought about learning something new to me, that would be up-to-date, rewarding, and challenging. Something that wouldn't
lose its utility and relevance in years.  
So I chose Programming, and Python became my first language.  
  
  
I'd had no educational background in this department. 
But I started gaining knowledge with the help of the worldwide community, using the free educational content of CS50, Computer Science Center, MFTI, as well as some great free web resources like Codeacademy, FreeCodeCamp, Stepik, HackerRank, Codewars, JetBrains Academy, Exercism, and many more. Currently, Coursera is my buddy.
