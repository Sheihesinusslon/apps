# Hi there!

My name is Nikita. I'm 27, from Saint-Petersburg.  
  
Recently I've started learning Programming and Computer Sciense. Some time ago I was contemplating about changing my professinal field.  
I thought about learning something new to me, that would be up-to-date, useful and challenging. Something that wouldn't
lose it's utility and relevance in years.  
So I stopped on Programming, and Python became my first language.  


I have no educational background in this department,  
but I'm keepin up, using lectures as well as some great free web resources like Codeacademy, FreeCodeCamp, Stepik and Codewars.
  
My projects and finished courses are listed down bellow.
