### Hi there!

My name is Nikita. I'm 27, from Saint-Petersburg.  
Recently I've started learning Programming and Computer Sciense. Some time ago I was contemplating about changing my professinal field.  
I thought about learning something new to me, that would be up-to-date, useful and challenging. Something that wouldn't
lose it's utility and relevance in years.  
So I stopped on Programming, and Python became my first language.  


I have no educational background in this department,  
but I'm keepin up, using Universities lectures as well as some great free web resources like Codeacademy, FreeCodeCamp and Codewars.  

```This repo is a container of portfolio projects that I've done so far as my programming practice.  ```
