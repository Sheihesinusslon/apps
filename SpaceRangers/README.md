Hello World!

This game is an implementation of old school arcade game "Space Invaders", 
done for training purposes by following 'Tech with Tim' Tutorial
video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/Q-__8Xw9KTM

Also added a theme music and the title from another 
my all time favourite game "Space Rangers" by the Russian company Elemental Games.
