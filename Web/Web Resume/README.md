# Hello World!  
  
This is my **Digital Resume.**  
  
I started it as a practice for Django, following a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://youtu.be/0oSsLbh_Kv4 "jango Tutorial - Create a Digital Resume with a Python Backend"). Slightly modified for my purposes: added CSS styles and flash messages. Added automatic Email notification for a contact form submission event (in a separate thread!).  
  
First version of the app was deployed on Heroku, for that AWS S3 bucket was added and configured.  
Later due to the problems with AWS account it was redeployed on [Pythonanywhere](http://sheihesinusslon.pythonanywhere.com/)  
  
```Python + Django + some native JS used```
